    <h3><a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/morocco/introduction#ixzz4Kc2dcb9w">Morocco, Casablanca</a></h3>
    <p>Morocco is one of the most diverse countries in Africa with high mountains, sweeping desert, rugged coastline and winding alleyways. With sheer beauty of its environmentally friendly landscapes, Morocco is divided into <em>four</em> different features.</p>
     <ul>
       <li>The Mountains</li>
       <li>Rif Region</li>
       <li>The Sahara Desert</li>
       <li>The Beaches</li>
     </ul>

    <p>Under the guidance of <strong>King Mohammed VI</strong> and his plan of Vision 2010, the Moroccan government is taking great efforts to improve infrastructure that is needed to support about 10 million visitors by 2010. Efforts are being taken to market Morocco as a cheap and exotic location yet safer for all tourists. Domestic tourism is also being popularized. The government is planning and executing good projects that are aimed at improving the rail and road links. The open skies policy has also allowed more airlines to come in into the country. The airports are being upgraded or new ones build to match the international standard and support larger number of air traffic. With improved relations with Algeria, the borders have been opened and air services between the two countries have resumed.</p>
    <p><strong>Often exotic, sometimes overwhelming and always unexpected</strong></p>

    <h3><a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/spain/introduction#ixzz4KbyKEPJA">Spain, Madrid</a></h3>
    <p>Spain's diverse landscapes stir in the soul. The Pyrenees and the Picos de Europa are as beautiful as any mountain range on the continent, while the snowcapped Sierra Nevada rises up improbably from the sun-baked plains of Andalucía; these are hiking destinations of the highest order. The wildly beautiful cliffs of Spain’s Atlantic northwest are offset by the charming coves of the Mediterranean.</p>

    <p>Food and wine are national obsessions in Spain. The touchstones of spanish cooking are deceptively simple. Traditional recipes handed down through the generations and innate willingness to experiment and see what comes out of the kitchen laboratory.</p>

    <p>This is a country that lives very much in the present and there's a reason <em>'fiesta'</em> is one of the best known words in spanish language, life itself is a fiesta here and everyone seems to be invited along a crowded postmidnight where the world has come out to play.</p>

    <p>Poignantly windswept Roman ruins, cathedrals of rare power and incomparable jewels of Islamic architecture speak of a country where the great civilisations of history have risen, fallen and left behind their indelible mark. Here, grand monuments to the past coexist alongside architectural creations of such daring that it becomes clear Spain's future will be every bit as original as its past.</p>

    <p><strong>Everywhere you go, villages of timeless beauty perch on hilltops, huddle in valleys and cling to coastal outcrops as tiny but resilient outposts of Old Spain.</strong></p>

    <h3><a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/jamaica/introduction#ixzz4Kc3tG7SE">Jamaica, Kingston</a></h3>
    <p>This tiny island has musical roots that date back to the folk songs of West Africa and forward to the electronic beats of contemporary dancehall. Jamaica is a musical powerhouse. Music is life in Jamaica. By its diverse culture, Jamaica also appreciates dance, sports, traditional fabrics and also festivals.</p>

    <p>Jamaica begins with crystalline waters flowing over gardens of coral, lapping onto soft sandy beaches, then rising past red soil and lush banana groves into sheer mountains. This is powerfully beautiful country, captivating to the eyes and soul. Jamaican culture can be a daunting subject for foreigners to understand, but ultimately it’s a matter of appreciating this land and how its cyclical rhythms set the pace of so much island life.</p>

    <p>Like many aspects of Jamaica culture, the food is a creole, born somewhere between the Old and New Worlds. African spice rubs have evolved into delicious jerk, while yam, rice and plantain form the basis of rich stews and the fish that abound in local waters. Throw in the astounding array of tropical fruits that seem to drip from the trees, washed down with a shot of rum</p>

    <p>Jamaica cries out to be explored. Underwater, on hikes, river-bound with a raft, underground with a lamp strapped to your head, or on the road by car or bicycle. Getting away from the (admittedly beautiful) beaches allows you to see sides of the island that many tourists miss.</p>

    <p><strong>The media might call Jamaica dangerous, but the worst crime you are likely to encounter is having your heart stolen.</strong></p>
